Good morning everyone. How did you all spend your weekend? Did
you go hiking perhaps or climb the mountains? Guess what I
did. Not hiking, not climbing, no – I spent the whole of
yesterday afternoon learning vocab with my best friend Tony! That
sounds a bit weird and boring, doesn’t it? But in fact it was
quite the opposite so keep listening and I’ll tell you more…
Let me think, it was probably a Friday afternoon when Tony and I
were on our way home after school and both noticed a giant
poster placed just at the entrance of subway line 1 ‘Volunteers
wanted - £50 awards to be won.’ £50 – it’s a lot right?
Obviously, Tony and I stopped to read this poster in more detail.
This poster says: ‘A test about computer-based vocab learning
method needs volunteers’. Specifically, ‘volunteers are divided to
two groups. The first group will learn with computers, while the
second group will learn the same words with traditional printed
books.’ Fellow classmates, you know how torturing it is to
memorise English vocabulary, don’t you? But as Tony and I
both wanted the £50 award, we still decided to apply to be
volunteers and luckily we ended up in the first group.
It was fun because it was designed like a game. First of all, the
screen shows you 5 words and their meanings, and then a teacher
pops up and reads each word aloud and explains its usage in
sentences and context. You then have to read these words as
correctly as possible so that the computer can identify the words
and give you a score. Then you enter a battle part – yes, that’s
right, the fun part is you get a chance to test your skills and beat
others.
Although Tony and I didn’t get the £50, this computer-based
learning experience completely changed our attitudes to lexical
learning and was a great way to spend our weekend.
Thank you Miss Stanley for asking me to deliver this speech and
thank you all for listening.
